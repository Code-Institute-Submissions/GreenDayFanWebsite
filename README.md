This is the Front End Development Mile Stone Project. The website is for a band.
I wanted the first page of the website to be clear and direct by only putting the hyperlinks to all
four pages on it at the top of the page.
The website will advertise tours and shows the band is playing, allow visitors to listen and watch 
music videos of the band and finally view photos of the band.

On the Tours/Bookings page the user will be able to contact the band for booking a show using text 
fields. 
The user will be required to fill out 3 boxes, Name, Email and Date of request. If any of these boxes
are empty, they will not be able to submit their request for a show.
After they click Send Request button, they will be brouhgt to a new page confirming the request was
received and they will hear back shortly with the email provided.

On the Songs/Videos page, the user will be able to select a previous album from the band and listen to
it by clicking the link on the image.

On the Photos page, I uploaded 8 photos of the band in concert and provided a link to more photographs
on another website. 

Creating this website, I used resources from w3schools , bootstrap, wix and CSS-Tricks
To see what colors would look good on the web and go well together, I looked at websites inlcluding:
