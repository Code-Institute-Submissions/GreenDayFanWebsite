This is the Front End Development Mile Stone Project. The website is for a band.
I wanted to make the first page of the website clear and direct by only putting the hyper links to all
four pages on it at the top of the page.
The website will advertise tours and shows the band is playing, let people listen and watch music 
videos of the band and view photos of the band.
On the Tours/Bookings page the user will be able to contact the band for booking a show using text 
fields, 1 field for the users email address and the other field for the date they want to book the 
band for. A button will be used to submit their request. Once the request button is clicked on, 
Creating this website, I used resources from w3schools, bootstrap, wix and CSS-Tricks
To see what colors would look good on the web and go well together, I looked at websites below:
