This is the Front End Development Mile Stone Project. The website will be for a band.
It will advertise tours and shows the band is playing, let people listen and watch music videos
from the band and also view photos of the band.
On the page that displays tours and shows, the user will be able to contact the band about
booking a show using 2 text fields, 1 field for the users email address and the other field for the
date they want to book the band for. A button will be used to submit their request.
Creating this website, I used resources like Bootstrap.
